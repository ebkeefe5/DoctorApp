# DoctorApp
This is an iphone app I created for my senior thesis. It was availible to download on the app store for one year from 2019-2020. 
It is designed to help patients relax at the doctor's office and offers the following features:
* two fun games to stay distracted
  * dog suduku which was played on a 6 by 6 board and using 6 unique thumbnails of different types of dogs instead of 6 numbers
  * a game involving tapping on a circle that is rather difficult to describe
* a section that provides information on what to expect at some of the most common office visits
* a section where you can take notes from your visit
* a section containing relaxing guitar songs that my guitar teacher Joan Doan offered to let me use for free
