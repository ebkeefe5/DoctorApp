# DoctorApp
This is an iphone app I created for my senior thesis. It was availible to download on the app store for one year from 2019-2020. 
It is designed to help patients relax at the doctor's office and offers the following features:
-two fun games to stay distracted, including dog suduku (same as normal suduku but with dogs as icons)
-a section that provides information on what to expect at some of the most common office visits
-a section where you can take notes from your visit
